# About Me 

Hi, I’m Freddie, a 14-year-old technology enthusiast from the United Kingdom. 

**What I Do**
I spend most of my time tinkering with technology and refurbishing old devices and selling them on. More recently, I have begun to engage in a few other types of things including graphic design and Discord Bot coding. 

Here is a little bit about each of the projects that I either run or contribute to: 

**FarnBourne Media**: A media group that currently operates a few YouTube channels but plans to expand into blogging and podcasting in the near future. I am their system administrator, co-founder, technology content director and soon to be podcast host.

**YouTube Hub Discord Server**: A Discord community server for YouTube content creators. While I’m not a content creator myself, I do have experience. I am the owner and founder of this server.

**Farnfield Photography**: A (kind of dead) photography Instagram account of mine that hasn’t been active sinse last year but I plan to bring back in the future.

**Graphic Design**: I design graphics for all of my projects. I don’t yet offer my services to anyone else but if you are interested, please contact me on Instagram or Discord (whichever is easier)
